## Diabetes Readmission Prediction - Machine learning - Master's Project

The "DiabetesReadmitPredictor" repository is my master's project, aiming to forecast hospital readmissions for diabetes patients. 

It explores feature selection, data normalization, and class imbalance rectification. 

With both binary and multiclass classification models, the project strives to enhance predictive accuracy. 

This initiative can be helpful for healthcare improvement and offers a valuable resource for data prediction in the medical field.
